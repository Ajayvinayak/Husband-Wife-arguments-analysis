# Husband and Wife Arguments Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing verbal interactions between spouses, particularly during arguments. It aims to identify communication patterns, emotional triggers, and potential resolutions. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques, we seek to uncover insights into how couples navigate conflicts.

## Introduction

Conflicts between partners are inevitable in any relationship, but how couples handle disagreements can significantly impact relationship dynamics. This project aims to analyze the verbal and emotional aspects of husband and wife arguments to gain a deeper understanding of what escalates conflicts and what helps resolve them.

The key objectives are:
- Understanding emotional tones during arguments.
- Identifying patterns in language used by each partner.
- Studying argument dynamics over time.

## Data Collection

Data for this project comes from recorded conversations between spouses, either from publicly available datasets (like the Couples Interaction Study) or collected via surveys and interviews. Each conversation is transcribed and labeled with the following:
- Speaker (Husband or Wife)
- Emotional Tone (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- Timestamp
- Content of the dialogue

Note: Ensure that any data used adheres to privacy guidelines, and participants' identities remain anonymous.

## Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for analysis, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Transcription Cleaning**: Removed fillers, background noise, and irrelevant information.
- **Speaker Separation**: Classified each sentence based on who spoke (husband or wife).
- **Sentiment Labeling**: Each line of dialogue was assigned an emotional tone using NLP-based sentiment analysis models.
- **Tokenization**: Split sentences into individual words/tokens for linguistic analysis.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**
We used pre-trained sentiment analysis models to classify each utterance into emotional categories (Positive, Neutral, Negative). This helps identify when conversations escalate or de-escalate emotionally.

### 2. **Topic Modeling**
Using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we extracted common themes in arguments. This helps in understanding the frequent topics of contention between spouses.

### 3. **Conversation Dynamics**
By analyzing the temporal flow of arguments (who interrupts, how quickly someone responds), we explored conversation dynamics, including whether certain behaviors lead to conflict resolution.

### 4. **Textual Features**
We extracted features like:
- Word count per speaker
- Use of personal pronouns (e.g., "I", "you")
- Emotional intensity words

### 5. **Machine Learning Models**
We applied machine learning algorithms to predict whether a particular argument will escalate or be resolved based on language patterns, speaker dominance, and sentiment shifts.

## Results

The key findings from our analysis include:
- **Emotional triggers**: Certain phrases and emotional tones tend to escalate arguments.
- **Gender differences**: There are observable differences in how husbands and wives communicate, particularly in emotional expression.
- **Resolution patterns**: Phrases that indicate openness or concession tend to help de-escalate arguments.

Visualizations of the results can be found in the `results/` directory.
